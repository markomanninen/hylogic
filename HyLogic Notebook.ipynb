The last two macros also creates a negated propositional variable to reduce some repetitive work. In `HyLogic` a proposition consists of one mandatory and two optional parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mandatory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A propositional variable that is usually denoted by a capital letter like $P$, $Q$, and $R$. Often small letters are used too but we have reserved small letters for predicate variable names. But it is really up to you, what letters to use. You can use multi-character symbols too. For example $VaR!$ is a proper symbol name as well. Using commonly used variable names and conventions improves readability and understandability of the logic expressions however. A propositional variable is also called a [sentential variable](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SententialVariable.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional (statement):\n",
    "\n",
    "2) A truth value that is either $True$ or $False$. Default is $True$. A truth value can also be defined by using the number $1$ for $True$ and the number $0$ for $False$ or by using constant symbols $⊤$ and $⊥$ respectively. Note that in some [logic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic) $⊥$ may be used for \"unknown\" rather than $False$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) A sentence that is a literal representation of the proposition such as the phrase \"Today is Tuesday\". Default is an empty string (\"\"). Althought in `HyLogic` it doesn't really matter what is the content of the sentence, in practice we urge to find out [complementizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementizer) from the written natural text. It means that in the sentence there should be a clear situational condition mentioned. If there is a [state of affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_affairs_&lpar;philosophy&rpar;) in the sentence like \"A is B\" then it becomes a truth-maker and consequently we are able to transfer it to a proposition, which then is a truth-bearer.\n",

    "From the output we find each proposition and their negation represented in a string format that distinguishes all three aspects of the proposition, namely the symbol, the literal representation, and the truth value of the proposition.\n",

    "### Semantical notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe a small explanation here is in place because understanding the basic components of the propositional logic requires the understanding of the common convention on how propositional logic works and how it is represented in a written or a spoken format.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define the proposition $P$ to mean \"Today is Tuesday\" and to be $False$, the following happens. We define that the symbol $P$ denotes the sentence \"Today is Tuesday\" in natural human language. We also define that the truth value of the statement is $False$. Thus we *could* understand the proposition $P$ to say something like \"Today is not Tuesday\" or maybe even something like: \"Today is Tuesday\", but that the statement is not true!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a possible pitfall in these expressions. Strictly speaking, the proposition $P$, as an object in `HyLogic`, is just stating that it has the sentencial property which value is \"Today is Tuesday\" and it has the truth value which is $False$. And **that statement is metalogically true** because the proposition object has been stored in the computer memory in that state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part is important. We have to rely on the top-most metalogical axiom that all statements, as they are expressed, are invariantly true. Also, we are not trying to determine if it is really Tuesday today. In some sense, logic is not meant to find out truth from the world, but to help to follow logical steps to determine the consequence of the predefined true statements. Given the assumptions are true, and logical rules are followed, then we can count on that the consequence is true too. In our example we defined $P$ to be $False$ and then we will deduce the rest of the argumentation according to that definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the negation of the proposition $P$, which is automaticly generated by the `defproposition*` macro, is $¬P$ (read: not $P$). By literal representation it could be written: \"It is not the case that Today is Tuesday\". `HyLogic` module doesn't try to formulate literal representations of the negated sentences. Module just formulates negations by prepending $¬$ symbol to the propositional variable and switching the truth value to its opposite. Sentence is left intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth value of the negation of $P$ in our example is $True$ because the original $P$ was defined to be $False$ and because we defined negation to work such way in the basic axioms and theorems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truth-bearer in action\n",

    "\n",
    "At first glance, the separate mutable truth value may feel unnecessary and confucing. Why should we reassert, that \"Today is Tuesday\" is $True$, because the truthness is already stated in the sentence? Separation is really the key to prevent \"real\" paradoxes occur in the classical logic. Take for example the famous variation of the [Liar's Paradox](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LiarsParadox.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>\"This sentence is false\"</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Eubulides](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EubulidesParadox.html), who formulated it in the fourth century BC, said that if *that* sentence, or proposition, is true, then *it* can't be true, because *it* says *it* is false, hence the paradox. Paradox means that the given clause is both true and false at the same time, or neither one, or that the truthness of the statement changes mutually. So we can't decide which one it is, true or false. In reality, the paradox comes from the confusion of the references of the properties of the proposition. That's why *it* was written in italics. References are often ambiguous in a written language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model theory\n",
    "\n",
    "In HyLogic, the sentence itself doesn't define or hold the truth value of the proposition. The truth value and the sentence are properties of the proposition, as is the selected symbol too, for example $P$. For the practical purposes we have modelled that the proposition is an object with three properties. We can describe the set of proposition objects $x$ having $Symbol$, $TruthValue$, and $Sentence$, latter two having no mutable $Relation$ with this notation:\n",

    "b) to use only the alternative symbol, instead of the sentence, and say that the proposition $P$ has the truth value $True$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it becomes apparent that what we try to define in the Liar's Paradox is that $P$ is $True$. There is no contradiction or paradox in this representation. Whatever is stated in the sentence of proposition $P$, it does not affect to the truth value of the statement. The truth value is a separate and an independent property (attribute) from the sentence. Moreover, the truth value doesn't have a mutable relation to the sentence, just to the overall state of the proposition. This can be properly presented by a [model theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/model-theory/) and is clearly emphasized in the [semantic theory of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_theory_of_truth).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No self-references, please\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also easy to see that as a logical statement, the sentence \"This proposition is false\" is not well defined  because it does not really contain a clear state of affair for the proposition. To formulate it to logic language it would become \"This proposition\" is $True$. But then \"This proposition\" does not have a truth claim as we would expect. Compare to similar \"Today is tuesday\" is $True$, which makes clear claim on the sentence. \"Today is Tuesday\" tries to make the truth. \"This proposition\" phrase is not a truth-maker and doesn't really fit for propositional statement. Again, not that it would have any effect in `HyLogic`, where the sentence could very well be just an empty string!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, according to basic axioms, all statements are true. This requirement prevents the possibility of the infinite truth value assigment, that is, the self-referencial mutability of the truth value. Together these axioms prevents paradoxes to occur in HyLogic, or classical logic more generally. Solution has familiar identities, because we designed three properties on a proposition model categorically similar to Kleene's strong three-valued logic. And we designed the lowest level of hierachy with metalogical \"All statements are true\" that is also similar to Russell's and Tarski's solutions of paradoxes. Plus there is a reference to Gödel's first incompleteness theory, because the unique metalogical axiom, really just a model in a computer memory, is the necessary axiomatic system outside of the logic system itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Althought, this may sound promising, there is still \"the million dollar\" problem open:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>The idea is that whatever semantic status the purported solution claims the liar sentence to have, if we are allowed freely to refer to this semantic status in the object language, we can generate a new paradox.</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-reference/\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Self-references, yes!\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposed logic system does not invoke self-references in theory. But the language platform, Hy in this question, does not prevent of using self-references and mutate the truth-value. It is easy to make an infinite loop and demonstrate that situation.\n",
